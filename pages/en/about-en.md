# About

## My Mission

I help bridge the communication gap between finance and technology. Over years of consulting, I’ve seen talented professionals struggle to meet their goals simply because they don’t share the same language. My mission is to empower them with data-driven solutions that align their expertise.

## Background & Experience

With a master’s in finance, a CFA, and over a decade in the industry, I bring hands-on experience across startups and financial institutions. My work spans financial analysis, software architecture, and project leadership, enabling me to tackle complex challenges with insight and precision.
