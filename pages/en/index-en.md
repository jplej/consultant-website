# Testimonials

I was responsible for the financial modeling behind the D-Risk SaaS solution, which bridges the gap between FX brokers and international SMEs. Automating treasury management and optimizing hedging strategies were crucial for the platform, along with prioritizing the tight backlog to deliver complex features on time.
