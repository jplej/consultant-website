## Initial Assesment

Our Digital Transformation Assessment involves a storyboarding workshop, stakeholder interviews, and a thorough analysis of systems and suppliers to identify inefficiencies and opportunities. The result is a comprehensive report with an executive summary highlighting strengths and weaknesses, accompanied by a strategic roadmap with actionable milestones to drive improved efficiency and data-driven decision-making in your front office.
